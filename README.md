# Precipitation-Prediction
# ☁️ Precipitation Prediction using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project aims to **predict precipitation amounts** based on meteorological variables such as **cloud cover, wind speed, humidity, and temperature**. Given that precipitation is a **continuous numerical value**, this is a **regression problem**. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately estimate rainfall amounts in **10 mm increments**.
